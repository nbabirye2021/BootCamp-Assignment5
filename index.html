            The best advice I ever got for preparing for baby #2 from moms that have been there and lived to tell about it. 
Anticipating Kaitlyn’s arrival, despite only being 5 years ago, seems like such a distant memory.<br> 
However, some of the sentiments I felt leading up to her May debut are easy to recall. </p>

<p class="one">I remember feeling a little sad that I was revoking Hailey’s only child status. Would she resent me? Then there was the worry no mother likes to admit to- will I be able to love this next child as deeply and completely as my first?

Well, this post isn’t about those things, because though I can emphatically say that giving Hailey a sister was the best gift we ever could have given her (by her own admission).

And I’m sure you’ve heard the human heart is incredible because falling head over heels in love with Kaitlyn was effortless (remember our first day in the hospital together?), I know someone telling you those things won’t ease your worries that it may not work out that way for you. (It will though)

<p class="one"> I want to pass on the real advice for preparing for baby #2, the nitty gritty given to me from friends (both online and IRL alike) that had been through it and decided they liked me enough to pass on the tips for surviving those early days while adjusting to having more than one child in my solo care.

So while I’d like to take full credit for the following, it’s actually way more valuable than my words alone because it’s been tested and proven by multiple moms over several years— so please pin it

        <h2> Parenting</h2>
        <p class="two">
            There is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting but I’ve learned more from my own experiences and talking with other moms than I’ve ever learned in a book. Let’s talk about it all- the tantrums, the snuggles, the struggles, and the love.

           <h2>8 Questions to Ask a New Babysitter</h2> 

           <p>Finding a sitter for the first time is nerve-wracking, especially if it’s for your first baby. As a family we’ve had some wonderful sitters and a select one or two that didn’t end up working out so well. Fact: I once came home in the middle of the day to a sitter sleeping while Hailey and Kaitlyn were toddling around the playroom. Trial and error, my friends, trial and error.
